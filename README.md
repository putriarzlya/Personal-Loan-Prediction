The "Personal Loan Prediction" project utilizes five different machine learning models to predict loan eligibility. These models include K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Boosting algorithms. Each model is tailored to analyze customer data and predict whether they qualify for a personal loan. By implementing these models, the project aims to determine which approach yields the most accurate predictions, providing valuable insights for decision-making in the loan approval process.
